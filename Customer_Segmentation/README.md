# Customer Segmentation

/* Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics, 
such as demographics, behavior, and purchase history. The goal of customer segmentation is to identify
high yield segments - that is, those segments that are likely to be the most profitable or that have 
growth potential - and to develop strategies to target these segments.

In this project, I used SQL to extract and analyze data from the customer_seg table. The table contains 
information about customers, such as their user_id, gender, age, salary, and purchase history (1 or 0) and date.
