# Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty Analysis For the Instacart Shop

Project Description:
This project aimed to identify the 10 least performing products in terms of quantity ordered and analyze customer satisfaction for these products using the 
Net Promoter Score (NPS) framework.
First, I analyzed the sales data of the products from the Instacart database and identified the 10 products that had the lowest quantity of orders. I then prepared a 
customer survey with a question asking customers to rate their likelihood of recommending these products to a friend or colleague on a scale of 0-10.
I distributed the survey to a sample of customers from different segments and collected their responses. The survey form was created using google form that was 
connected to the database. Using the NPS framework, I calculated the percentage of promoters (customers who rated the product 9 or 10), detractors (customers who 
rated the product 0 to 6), and passives (customers who rated the product 7 or 8) for each of the 10 least performing products.
My analysis showed that the NPS scores for the 10 products ranged from -60% to 35.71%, indicating that most of the customers were dissatisfied with these products. 
I also found that the percentage of passive respondents for each product varied between 25% to 50%, indicating that these customers are not completely satisfied with 
the product and may switch to other products in the future.*/
