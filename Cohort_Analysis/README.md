# COHORT ANALYSIS
Cohort analysis is a powerful tool used to understand customer behavior and identify patterns in customer 
behavior over time. It helps to segment customers based on their acquisition date or any other relevant 
criteria and then track their behavior over time. This type of analysis is particularly useful for businesses 
that have a recurring revenue model, such as subscription-based services, and it can be used to identify key 
metrics such as customer retention, lifetime value, and churn rate.

The main goal of cohort analysis is to identify trends and patterns in customer behavior, which can then be used 
to inform marketing, product development, and customer service strategies. For example, if a business finds that 
customers who joined in a certain month have higher retention rates than those who joined in other months, they 
might focus their marketing efforts on acquiring more customers in that month. Similarly, if they find that customers 
who join at a certain age have higher lifetime value than those who join at other ages, they might focus on targeting 
that age group in their marketing efforts.

Overall, the cohort analysis is a powerful tool to gain insights into customer behavior and improve the business 
performance. It can be used to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior over time, and then use that information 
to inform business decisions and improve the customer experience.
