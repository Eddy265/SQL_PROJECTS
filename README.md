# SQL PROJECTS
Welcome to my SQL projects repository! This is a collection of some of my personal projects that showcase my proficiency in SQL. 
The projects in this repository cover a wide range of topics, from database design, data manipulation and analysis to data filtering and extraction. 
Each project includes the SQL code used, as well as a brief explanation of the problem addressed and the insights gained from the analysis. 
Whether you're a beginner looking to improve your SQL skills or an experienced developer looking for inspiration for your next project, 
I hope you find something of value here. Thanks for visiting!
